# Changelog

## 3.1.0-beta.1 — 7 Sep 2026

- **Connectors are real.** The top bar shows the MCP servers your Claude Code is connected to (`claude mcp list`), not a demo list. Servers that need authentication show grey with the reason on hover and are not wired to any pod. Unknown servers get an initials tile. Nothing connected? The bar says so.
- **Agents use tools.** While they work, agents can call those same connected servers, plus web search (`tools.web`). Bash, file tools and sub-agents stay off. Standing rule: read freely; send, post, pay, delete or change data outside the machine only when the task explicitly asks for that exact action. A deliverable says which tools it used, the note records them, and the logos pulse with the real call.
- **The roster is yours.** `office.agents.json` holds the 33 agents: name, role, what they do, their tools. Override in `office.agents.local.json` (ignored by git). Departments, leads and seats stay fixed. A `CLAUDE.md` in the repo means you can open Claude Code in the folder and say what you want changed.
- `office.config.json` grew `mcp.allow` / `mcp.deny` / `mcp.departments` and `tools.web`; `timeout` (seconds) for long tool runs.
- Live chat now opens with the agent's real job description instead of the demo greeting and sample file.
- `npm run check` validates the roster and the connector endpoint.

## 3.0.0-beta.4 — 6 Sep 2026

- Dark mode: press D, add `#dark=1`, open `command-centre-v2-dark.html`, or visit http://localhost:4520/dark. The scene relights, pods and walkways re-tint, the Brain and wires swap ink.

## 3.0.0-beta.3 — 6 Sep 2026

- No more "demo" label: the panel shows LIVE · CLAUDE when the server is connected and nothing otherwise.

## 3.0.0-beta.2 — 6 Sep 2026

- The Brain strip is gone from the task panel. Open the Brain with G, by clicking the pod, or by its tag.

## 3.0.0-beta.1 — 6 Sep 2026

Agents Office v3 (Beta): the V3 office as a real, installable app.

- Six departments, 33 agents, each with a role, a voice and a task pool.
- Task Status panel with a command bar: type a task, pick the department, the office routes it to the right agent through Claude and the agent produces the deliverable, saved as a note in your brain folder.
- The Brain is your own folder of Markdown notes with `[[wiki links]]`, drawn as a graph over the centre pod, rebuilt live as agents write. `G` opens the full graph with search and a note preview.
- Chat with any agent: real conversation in that agent's persona, grounded in your notes. `revise: …` reworks the last deliverable.
- Runs on your existing Claude Code login, or on an API key if you set one. Nothing leaves your machine except the calls to Claude.
- `npm run check` — the build loop: build, offline smoke, server smoke; `npm run check:live` adds one real task and one chat turn.


## 0.1.0 — 7 Aug 2026
